    author: 'Jane Austen',
    text: `Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
    by the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the
    Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His
    marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned
    as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured
    tone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the
    wedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and
    when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s
    ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,
    accompanied her out of the room.`

    author: 'Mary Shelley',
    text: `As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress
    was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and
    my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,
    with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman
    expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years
    passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was
    engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I
    hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive
    of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as
    others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in
    a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
    A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must
    infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who
    continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was
    solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two
    years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical
    instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the
    university. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well
    acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as
    depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my
    residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought
    of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident
    happened that protracted my stay.`

    title: "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland",
    author: 'Lewis Carroll',
    text: `Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
    much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
    passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
    out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
    flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
    through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought
    poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
    how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
    knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
    happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
    indeed were really impossible.`

    title: 'A Tale of Two Cities',
    author: 'Charles Dickens',
    text: `Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he
    came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with
    a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand
    heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of
    manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might
    have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself
    in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being
    sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright
    shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large
    earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick
    her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported
    by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but
    coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting
    of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a
    line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the
    shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while
    he stepped over the way.`

    title: 'The Great Gatsby',
    author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald',
    text: `I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and
    that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he
    gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched
    out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was
    from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced
    seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute
    and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked
    once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the
    unquiet darkness.`
